# Python Pomodoro
A personal Python script that I use to set a Pomodoro timer.

# Dependencies
_osascript_ is needed. It executes AppleScripts and other OSA language scripts. In our case, it is used to create simple notifications with sound alerts.

Run the command:

```sh
pip install osascript
```
# How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. From the terminal, run the following command:

```sh
python3 pomodoro.py
```

3. The script will start and will ask you the amount of time with which you want to set the Pomodoro
4. Choose the timing and run the script
